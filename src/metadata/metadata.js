As a Software Engineer, I was responsible for participating in the entire systems lifecycle, from the initial technical analysis to production release. This included designing the architecture of new digital solutions in collaboration with software architects, developing software from scratch, and maintaining or refactoring existing code to ensure consistently high-quality standards.

The teams were international, operating remotely across the globe, and followed Agile Scrum methodologies. Beyond my core responsibilities, I also led initiatives on features involving multiple teams, ensuring alignment and convergence toward common goals.

Some key contributions:

* Managed the onboarding process for new customers via mobile apps (Android/iOS).
* Designed, developed, and maintained a CRM system to help personal bankers manage customer accounts, communications, and support activities.
* Implemented appointment reservation feature for both customers (via the mobile app) and personal bankers (via the CRM system).
* Integrated SMS and email notification system for customers and personal bankers.
* Developed and maintained a distributed system that processes sensitive customer data on a scheduled basis.
* Proposed and implemented efficient solutions to reduce technical debt and improve code maintainability.
* Consistently met tight deadlines while ensuring high software quality and adherence to best practices.
